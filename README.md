# Intro

This is a simple theme made using awesome things like [bootsrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [fontawesome](http://fontawesome.io/). You should have sass compiler such as sassc installed to generate css files.

It should look more or less like this [demo](https://haaja.github.io/bootstrap-sass-theme/).

## Running

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/haaja/bootstrap-sass-theme
$ cd bootstrap-sass-theme
$ sassc sass/app.scss css/app.css
$ python -m http.server 8080
```
You can use any other http-server as well or simply open index.html in browser.
